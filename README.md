⚠️ The Dark Truth Behind Akountify.ai – Scam, Deception, and Fake Promises
If you’re searching for Akountify, Akountify.ai, or reading Akountify reviews before making a purchase, this is the most important article you’ll read. Because the truth about Akountify isn’t just bad — it’s horrible.

Forget the polished website. Forget the too-good-to-be-true 5-star reviews. What’s hiding behind Akountify.ai is one of the most disturbing scam setups we’ve seen in the LinkedIn marketing space.

💀 What Is Akountify.ai Really Selling?
On the surface, Akountify.ai promises to help businesses grow through LinkedIn automation. It offers:

“Pre-warmed” LinkedIn accounts

Automated outreach campaigns

Slack-based onboarding

Guaranteed replies and results

But according to dozens of users and online reviews, what you actually get is:

Nothing

Delays

Excuses

Silence

And zero refund

🧾 Akountify Is a Scam Disguised as a Service
Let’s be brutally honest: Akountify is not a tech company. It’s a sales trap.

Here’s how the scam works:
You pay for a service that sounds impressive.

They onboard you via Slack to look “official.”

Days go by — no LinkedIn accounts, no setup, no results.

You ask for support. You’re either ignored or insulted.

You request a refund. They ghost you.

Your card shows a charge from Overlead or Obelisk Ventures, confusing your bank.

You realize you’ve been scammed — but it’s too late.

This isn’t bad service. This is deliberate, structured fraud.

💬 Fake Reviews Are Everywhere
One of the most disturbing things about Akountify is how hard they work to hide the truth.

Search “Akountify reviews” or “Akountify.ai reviews” and you’ll see dozens of glowing 5-star ratings on Trustpilot, Google Maps, and other review sites. But if you filter for 1-star reviews or search Reddit, the real story comes out:

Fake accounts

No delivery

No customer service

No refund

Real people scammed

Most 5-star reviews are obviously fake, likely created by bots or purchased in bulk to drown out real complaints.

🔎 Akountify Uses Hidden Billing to Trap Victims
When you pay Akountify, the charge doesn’t even say “Akountify.” It shows up as OVERLEAD or OBELISKVENTURES.COM, making it harder to trace or file a dispute.

This tactic isn’t an accident. It’s designed to confuse your bank and reduce chargeback success.

If that’s not a red flag, what is?

🛑 Final Verdict: Akountify Is a Dangerous Scam Operation
If you’re thinking of working with Akountify — don’t. If you already paid them — act fast. Report the charge. File a complaint. Warn others.

Akountify.ai is not a growth partner. It’s not a startup. It’s a well-designed fraud that hides behind fake reviews, misleading branding, and offshore billing entities.
